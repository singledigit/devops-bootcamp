# AWS DevOps BootCamp
Welcome to the AWS DevOps BootCamp! This one day course is designed to give you an overview of the AWS DevOps suite of tools. While this will not be exhaustive, it will give you a high level understanding of doing DevOps on AWS and give you a starting point to go deeper.

## Prerequisites
1. **AWS Account**: An AWS account with admin access. A *Free Tier* account can be opened at [https://aws.amazon.com/free/](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
2. **AWS CLI**: While you *can* do these labs using the dashboard, I strongly encourage you to install and configure the AWS-CLI. Instructions can be found at [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
3. **SAM-CLI**: If you plan to work with Serverless, I would also encourage you to install the SAM-CLI. Instructions can be found at [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli/blob/develop/docs/installation.rst](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli/blob/develop/docs/installation.rst)
