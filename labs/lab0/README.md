# Configuring for the Lab
In the bootcamp today we will be working through several labs that require AWS access and tooling. We will walk through the following steps to get configured. Make sure to go in order as it is important.

1. [Create an IAM User](./iam.md)
2. [Create a Cloud9 Environment](./cloud9.md)
3. [Create an EC2 Key Pair](./keypair.md)
