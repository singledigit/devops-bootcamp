# Obtaining the Lab Resources
We are going to grab the lab resources from a public git repo.

1. In Cloud, locate the **terminal** window at the bottom of the screen. You should see a prompt that looks somethung like **~/environment**. It might be slightly different.
2. After the **$** paste the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/singledigit/do-bc
```
3. Change to the newly created folder
```
cd do-bc
```

You now have a folder called **do-bc** that has all the resources you will need for today's session.
