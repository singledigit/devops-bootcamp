# Lab One: Launching Your First Stack
Welcome to your first lab of the AWS DevOps Bootcamp!! In this lab you will launch a simple "Hello World" node website.

You have two options for this exercise.
1. [AWS Dashboard](dashboard.md)
2. [AWS CLI](cli.md)

If you have time, I encourage you to try both!
